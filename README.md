### Background:
We are big fans of Magic: the gathering here, and being so we watch a Lot of MTG streams on Twitch.

The thing is that if you want to quickly see all the MTG Twitch streams right now you have to go to the website and find the game

So we decided to make thing easier for us with this very basic chrome app.
